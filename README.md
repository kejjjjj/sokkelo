# sokkelo - a cool maze generator

- This tool isn't really made for public use, it's mainly just a little project I've been working on that I wanted to show off.

## What?

### - This tool generates random mazes

### - And solves them

## Why?

- Maze generation and solving looks cool (see the gifs above for more information)

## Features
1. Generation of mazes using either the Depth-First algorithm or the Aldous-Broder algorithm.
2. Some sort of AI, that can solve the maze given enough time and generations.
3. Ability to port generated mazes to CoD4 Radiant (compile-ready)


## Algorithms

### 1. Depth First (very simple, fast, not a lot of dead-ends)

### 2. Aldous-broder (complicated, slow, a lot of dead-ends)

## Exporting

### An exported map in CoD4 radiant

### An exported map in CoD4

### Exporting customization

## General customization

Grid - size of the pixels\
Size X - the "game" window horizontal size\
Size Y - the "game" window vertical size\
Draw dead-ends - does not draw dead-ends with the red color
